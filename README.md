### WIP

Run `node run.js client/index.js` to see the outputted code. At the moment, the plugin is not fully integrated with the webpack / babel set up that the rest of the React / Babel / Webpack setup would suggest.

#### Debug Mode
`node --inspect --debug-brk run.js client/index.js` will give you a URL to open in chrome to use Chrome's debugger / DevTools. Using the `debugger` keyword will stop execution just like it does in a JS app.
